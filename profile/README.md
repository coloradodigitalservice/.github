## Hi there 👋
We're the Colorado Digital Service (CDS)!

CDS is a cross-functional team of senior product managers, human-centered designers, engineers, and procurement & contracting specialists within the Governor’s Office of Information Technology (OIT).

We use a community-centered and outcomes-based approach to partner with agencies to design, build, and buy sustainable technologies that help Coloradans thrive.
